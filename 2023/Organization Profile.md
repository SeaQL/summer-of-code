<h5>Our Journey</h5>
<p>SeaQL.org was founded back in 2020. In the past three years, we published and maintained several popular Rust libraries: SeaORM, SeaQuery, and Seaography. Each library is designed to fill a niche in the Rust ecosystem, and they are made to play well with other Rust libraries.</p>
<p>We're thrilled with the adoption by the Rust community. At the end of 2022, we have accumulated 4,300 GitHub stars across our projects and accumulated 1 million total downloads on crates.io. 7 startups and many open source projects were built on SeaQL libraries.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Mission</h5>
<p>We help developers in building data intensive applications in Rust, whether they are web services (GraphQL, gRPC, REST), command line tools or apps.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Vision</h5>
<p>In the long term, we want to support all open source SQL, NewSQL and NoSQL databases, providing a uniform developer experience to data analytics, transaction processing and other data engineering work.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Values</h5>
<p>Community driven. Embrace the async Rust ecosystem. Welcome developers from other languages.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Commitment</h5>
<p>We are committed to nurturing the next generation of open source developers. We provide internship experience tailored for university students - Seaography and StarfishQL are both excellent projects developed by interns under SeaQL.</p>
