<h5>Our Journey</h5>

<p>SeaQL.org was founded back in 2020. In the past three years, we developed and maintained several popular Rust libraries: SeaORM, SeaQuery, and Seaography. Each library is designed to fill a niche in the Rust ecosystem, and they are made to play well with other Rust libraries.</p>

<p>We're thrilled with the adoption by the Rust community. At the end of 2023, we have accumulated 8,000 GitHub stars across our projects and accumulated 5 million total downloads on crates.io. Many startups and companies are building their products using SeaQL libraries.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Mission</h5>
<p>We develop tools that enable developers to build applications in Rust. We want to drive Rust adoption in industry and universities.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Vision</h5>
<p>We believe software can be fast, robust, and versatile. We want to develop and promote software engineering tools and techniques that would improve the productivity of engineers and quality of software.</p>
<br/>

<h5>Our Commitment</h5>
<p>We are committed to nurturing the next generation of open source developers by offering internship experience tailored for university students - Seaography is one of the projects developed by interns under SeaQL.</p>
