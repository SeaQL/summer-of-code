We were not accepted into [GSoC 2023](Ideas List.md). We still offered regular internships, but not in the same format.

This summer, we have taken in 2 interns:

1. [Ivan Yiu](https://github.com/darkmmon/) (Hong Kong). His contribution is focused on pushing forward [SeaORM 0.12](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/commits?author=darkmmon).
2. He resigned on his own accord
