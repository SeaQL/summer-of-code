# GSoC 2024 with SeaQL

[GSoC 2024 Organization Profile](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/seaql)

First of all, thank you for your interest in SeaQL and the intention to contribute.

## About SeaQL

In 2020, when we were developing systems in Rust, we noticed a missing piece in the ecosystem: an ORM that integrates well with the Rust async ecosystem.

The first piece of tool we released is [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query), a query builder with a fluent API. It has a simplified AST that reflects SQL syntax. It frees you from stitching strings together in case you needed to construct SQL dynamically and safely, with the advantages of Rust typings.

The next year we released [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), an Object Relational Mapper for building web services in Rust, whether it's REST, gRPC or GraphQL. We always have "async & dynamic" in mind, so developers from dynamic languages can feel right at home.

Then we developed [Seaography](https://github.com/SeaQL/seaography), a GraphQL framework for SeaORM. It helps you to spin up a basic GraphQL server in minutes.

In 2023, we felt like Rust needed a first-party debugger, so we spent a lot of time in designing and developing [FireDBG](https://firedbg.sea-ql.org/) - a time-travel visual debugger for Rust.

## Before you apply

Make sure you read everything on https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/ and [Internship @ SeaQL](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2023-01-28-internship-at-seaql/).

On top of that, there are a few points we'd want you to know:

1. GSoC is not (just) an internship. It's a privilege to be paid for open source contribution. So you have to put in 120% effort and compete for that privilege. You must have no other commitment during the project period.

2. Since the mode of work is fully-remote and async (as we will likely spread across different timezones), discipline and prompt communication is required.

3. Familiarity with the Rust language and the ecosystem is a must. The designs of our projects are based on Rust's unique features.

## How to apply

1. [Contribute to an existing project](#contribute-to-an-existing-project)
2. [Choose a GSoC Project](#choose-a-gsoc-project)
3. [Submit Your Application](#submit-your-application)

## Contribute to an existing project

We want our new contributors to be familiar with Rust and our projects. Please make at least one contribution to the project mentioned above on GitHub.

There are many forms of contributions:

 + Submitting pull request for an issue to implement a new feature or fix a bug. You might want to take on issue with "good first issue" label. We've got your back! You can always open an draft pull request and ask for help on GitHub or Discord.
 + Suggesting a new feature by filing an issue if you have any insightful ideas
 + Reviewing pull request if you are comfortable with the source code and want to peek into new features
 + Commenting on existing issue if you want to share your thoughts on it

## Choose a GSoC Project

We have composed a [GSoC project ideas list](README.md) for you to choose from. You can contact us through one of the channels listed below, introduce yourself and suggest your own project ideas before submitting your application. Feel free to chat with us if you have any questions or thoughts on the project idea.
